The data comes from "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" 
conducted by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto of Smartlab Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

After the raw data was processed, the tidy dataset only kept the mean and stardard deviation values.

The "activity" columns contains 6 types of activities, including:

WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

The tidy data contains 68 columns, including 2 columns of "activity" and "subject", and 66 specific data columns:
